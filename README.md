# Spam_Mail_Detection
This project focuses on detecting whether an email is spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. A Logistic Regression model is used for the classification task, where emails are first transformed into feature vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) before feeding them into the model.
